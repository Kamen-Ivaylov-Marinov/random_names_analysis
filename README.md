# random_names_analysis
# Task 1:
One name for each first letter and one name for each combination of the first and second letters.

# Task 2
0. Analyze the names. (Open task – generate some interesting statistics about the names, like: most names start with the letter A, many names are religious, or some are unusual.)

1. Based on the names, determine the likelihood that a child's name will start with a specific letter.

2. Similar to 1, but instead, calculate the likelihood that a name contains a given sequence of letters in that exact order (for example, "ASP" in the name "Aspen").

3. Similar to 2, but the letters can have other characters in between them. For example, how likely is it for a name to contain the letters x, y, z, even if they aren’t adjacent, like in the name "aXprYZ"?

4. Similar to 3, but the letters can appear in any order. For example, given the letters A, B, C, possible names could be "ABaCatus," "CABbage," or "BrACel."
